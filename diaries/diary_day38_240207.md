- Today I learned about design theory in design science. a very important point is that a competent system should serve a range of needs, we don't just develop a particular system, but we provide guidelines for developing a series of systems, and a particular system we develop is just an application case under guideline. So for autoethnographic recording software, we should think in a higher dimension - how to make a good design?
