- The very important INSIGHTS of the last class of the design science course today was - please forget about design science and just do the research that you feel is meaningful and contributing. I think this research is just that, my gift to myself for my first year of PhD.
- Today I worked on a series of codes. I did a comparison of two codes, the former not so strongly GPT-involved (project starting April 2023) and the latter strongly GPT-associated (project starting December 2023), which is very systematic.
