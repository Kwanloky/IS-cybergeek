- Today I used GPT to help me with some small paragraph writing for code. I suddenly remembered last March when ChatGPT was still hot. I was working on my graduation project, and there were many regular expressions that I didn't understand, and I had to look for answers in technical blogs. Now my working pattern has completely changed.GPT is really an epoch-making technology.
