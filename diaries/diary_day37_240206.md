- I have a feeling. After a variable is tested more, variation should gradually decrease, also known as convergence. So for the experience sampling method, subjective recording of data should not take too long I think.
- Today I used GPT to help me generate some research questions a little bit, but they weren't quite as good as I would have liked. I think the reason for the difference between the results of this and the results of my mentor's use may be the level of questioning. I think I'm going to learn how to ask questions, by checking out more courses on prompt engineering.
