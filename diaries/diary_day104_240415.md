- Today my teacher recommended me an AI touch up tool which simply encapsulates the prompt for a specific task so that I don't have to rewrite the prompt for the task every time.
- He told me that we can't just copy it in use, we need to double-check the expression of the AI, which can avoid a lot of potential problems.
