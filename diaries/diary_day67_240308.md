- Today is my birthday. I worked on data collation for three projects today.GPT helped me with some important touch-up rewriting.
- My instructor hand held me today to show me how to write a paper, and I realised that there are a lot of linguistic details that are difficult to turn into a PROMPT right away. This is better news, and it means that GPT will need to have more time to attack the myriad of human experiences.
