- The results of the first phase will be analysed up to day 60.
- I finished the first draft of one of my main papers today. During the revision process I realised that many of the papers that GPT has helped me with in the past have not been able to reach the top of the field. One of the reasons for this is that each field will have its own preferences, and these very many details result in a simple PROMPT output that is not very good. One possible solution is to use the full knowledge base of human scientific literature to train large models. I'm sure someone is already doing this.
- Today I finally solved a major three-day bug - a bug that caused me to have a fraction more data therefore causing the negative effect of one of my OLS models to be overestimated. Relying too much on the GPT doesn't work.
