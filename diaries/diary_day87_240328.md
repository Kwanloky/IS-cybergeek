- Today I referred to openai's prompt engineering tutorial. I learnt a very important misunderstanding I had in the past. The context length actually includes the previously consulted text as well. Thus asking questions multiple times frequently risks making things worse.
- I read carefully the tutorials given to people by claude and openai, and I found that the prompts written inside the former's prompt libraries are of lower quality.
