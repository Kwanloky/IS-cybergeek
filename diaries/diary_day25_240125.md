- Today a new CS research hotspot emerged: the multimodal large model Agents. I decided that this is a new paradigm for conducting simulation research in the social sciences. I am very interested and think I will conduct a series of game theory studies based on him. This requires me to complete the 3 studies of the thesis as soon as possible.
