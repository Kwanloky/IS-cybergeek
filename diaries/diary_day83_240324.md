- Today I found a blog that used to be very hot in the hacker community, it's about how to ask the right questions - How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way. and I found that it coincides with the idea of prompt engineering!

- kimi.ai seems to be getting hotter and hotter. I traced the reason for his explosion and found out that the reason is because he launched a super long contextual input service towards the end of last year. But I don't have a need for it as an individual user for the time being, so it's hard to understand his explosion.
- I realised today that I have some code that takes super long to run, which limits my productivity. But GPT hasn't helped me with that in the past.
