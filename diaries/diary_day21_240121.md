- Today I used GPT to help my friend polish up her resume. I've found that the GPT is great for extracting logic and organizing it into text with a complete grammatical structure - so a crying research topic is - people who are more detail-less but think outside the box would benefit more from the GPT.
- I have a new thing I want to do today. I'm hoping to create an idea bank visualization page that contains idea inputs and outputs that will be integrated into the autoethnography software. I think this is an important tool that can stimulate reflection among autoethnographers.
