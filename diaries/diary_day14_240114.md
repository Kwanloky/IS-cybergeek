- Today I worked on data labeling. We learned about in-text lerning as a method of labeling using LLMs. I am going to try this method in February.
- I got a "lifetime GPT-4 limits reached" error on GPT today, but it should just be an error that the account can't be used by more than one person at the same time.
- I'll be starting classes tomorrow. I look forward to utilizing GPT in my classes.
