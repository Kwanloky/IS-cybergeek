- Today I worked mainly on annotation. I am acutely aware of how using the GPT for annotation on a large scale can save a lot of human effort. The perception of the GPT's capabilities stems from social comparisons.
- I have an idea - using the GPT should improve one's emotional intelligence. When faced with a social dilemma, having the person and the GPT answer separately, the GPT I think would come back with a more emotionally intelligent answer. Further, the person should be able to learn a lot from this and in the long run improve their emotional intelligence.
