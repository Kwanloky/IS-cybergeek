- There has been some exciting discussion about claude 3 today. There have been a number of academics in specific STEM areas of expertise (even quantum mechanics) who have stated that their field has been conquered. It makes us wonder what kind of research is really meaningful. Perhaps duplication of effort is about to become a thing of the past. As an IS scholar I should be actively exploring what kind of research will not become obsolete.
