- (240103) As I was filling out the scale today I realized that since I didn't do too many creative coding activities today, I was unfamiliar with the scale questions when filling out the technological self-efficacy scale - which led to more conservative scoring compared to the previous two days. An important question to ask is whether familiarity with technology when filling out the scale affects technological self-efficacy? In other words technological self-efficacy should be a STATE personality rather than a TRAIT personality.
