- (240103) As I was filling out the scale today I realized that since I didn't do too many creative coding activities today, I was unfamiliar with the scale questions when filling out the technological self-efficacy scale - which led to more conservative scoring compared to the previous two days. An important question to ask is whether familiarity with technology when filling out the scale affects technological self-efficacy? In other words technological self-efficacy should be a STATE personality rather than a TRAIT personality.
- (240104) Today I realized that my technological self-efficacy scale assessment seems to have suffered due to the fact that I didn't code long enough, but did type some code. Carrying on from yesterday's thoughts, I think that the amount of time spent using a particular technology on a particular day may affect the scale results. Instead of generalizing about technology, one should more directly target a particular kind of technology to make the results more plausible.
