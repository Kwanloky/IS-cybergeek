- In the early hours of this morning, Ben and I were discussing something about the change in coefficients after adding fixed effects to the OLS. I pondered whether this matter could be replaced by LLMs and my conclusion was a definite a no. It follows that after using LLMs for a longer period of time one will have a better understanding of what they are capable of.
