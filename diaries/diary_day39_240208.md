- Today my friend asked me how to use GPT4, he wanted to do an augmented grant application with the help of GPT technology.
- Today I reused the crawler code written with the help of GPT and I realized that GPT does make more sense in terms of code architecture (I don't have a software engineering background). So one hypothesis is that GPT can help one get to an above average level very quickly. The ability to use GPT is very important (equates to having some knowledge of very many technologies)
