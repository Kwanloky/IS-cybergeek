- Today I tried gemeni1.5, a competitor to ChatGPT by google. He supports super long tokens, and in addition to that has done a great UI job of fine-tuning the output of the answers - for example, the user can choose whether or not the output has diversity (there are five levels)
- I've gotten into the habit of using prompts as my code comments. It's a good habit to force me to organize the logic of my code, and it also helps to temporarily store the input to GPT (sometimes GPT is not available and needs to wait).
