- Today OPENAI released Sora, which is capable of producing 60s high quality video with a simple one-sentence prompt, yet other products are still sprinting to the 10s video mark. This is a groundbreaking product. Although the review found some poor performances, this is normal and there is no doubt that he is very important. One way to look at it is that the implication behind this is that Sora can already understand the world, and therefore mankind is one major step closer to AGI - world modeling.
