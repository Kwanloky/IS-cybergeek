- Today I started by constructing the search form for the utd24 and ft50 journals. The back and forth cross-referencing of this process was very annoying to me. And GPT can't do this task for me very well. So if there are big models that can be optimised specifically for tedious tasks, even if they can't do very complex instructions, I think it would be very useful.
