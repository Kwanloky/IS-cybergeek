- Today, a study in the field of CS is of great interest in the field of Chinese large models. This study mentions that models trained using a more "abstract" corpus of Chinese Internet are more effective. This "abstract" means that the corpus is full of all kinds of Chinese hints, and this corpus is not accepted by the mainstream culture (many people think that this corpus is too entertaining and has no knowledge). So what does this mean, and are LLMs capable of extracting richer information?
