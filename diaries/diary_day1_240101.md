- On the first day, still feeling a little confused as to what I should do to make an ambitious and organized project, I approached GPT4 in the hope that it would help me create an initial project catalog (as you can see in the original github warehouse). 
- But I was convinced that I was quite interested in the project, which is why I decided to commit to a year-long project that would make full use of the LLMs and explore the potential of incorporating everything I had learned into information systems research.
- With respect to the Large Language Model, I have some key goals that I hope to achieve - publishing a qualitative MISQ paper, gaining the ability to independently develop software for use in my research, and writing a monograph that will help people in the information systems field utilize the LLM in their research.
- More specifically, my short-term goal is to first systematically document myself and develop software for researchers in the IS field who utilize self-report methods (this is not only of interest to me, but also facilitates the documentation of my daily routine, including scale self-assessment and journaling).
