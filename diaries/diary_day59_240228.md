- Today we learnt about ALTERNATIVE explanations and how to RULE OUT them. This has given me more confidence - I want to be rooted in the AIGC field and contribute to causal inference for related research.
- I think that for HCI we will have some important confounders. e.g. if we wish to study the effect of the degree of anthropomorphism on the dependent variable related to anyone's perception on the effect of the dependent variable, then the objective characteristics of the AI should be potential confounders. so an important repeated experiment would be to - Find some of the most important hypotheses in the field of anthropomorphisation and then go and test whether their conclusions still hold up when considering these confounders. So we can set some benchmarks for the field - which factors need to be considered and controlled for when designing experiments.
