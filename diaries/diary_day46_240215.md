- I reviewed a couple of qualitative studies today. I think our PROGRAM should learn their lesson - fluffy and hard to understand. So I think keeping a journal is a really good format and is another manifestation of trace data in qualitative research.
- Today I used GPT to help me with some code work. I provided him with detailed instructions and he did well.
- For the rest of the day I will try Chat with RTX.
- I have found that I will unconsciously want my questionnaire to be filled out differently than it was before to cause what is called fluctuations. this is not good. So I think one way to solve this is that there should be some kind of prompt before filling out the questionnaire to make me not care about this.
