- Today I used GPT to solve some residual problems of the code (such as how to delete duplicate variables automatically when df.merge). But this kind of code which is specific to my personal needs still needs me to think before I can write it out, GPT can't give me that much detailed help for the time being. So I think, briefly looking at GPT is more of a macro approach to save time rather than full of details.
- I'm about to collate the results of Phase 1 recently, and I thought it would be a great idea - to code the extent and aspects of my use of the GPT on that day, and then compare that with my technological self-efficacy on that day. I'm hoping to be able to provide some model-free insights.
