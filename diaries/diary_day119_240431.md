- I wasn't able to update my diary in time today due to my computer running out of battery and my charger not being with me.
- Today I had one of my exams in machine learning, a process in which I realised that having a discussion with a human being and reviewing it felt very different from reviewing it using GPT. I still find the former interaction more natural.
