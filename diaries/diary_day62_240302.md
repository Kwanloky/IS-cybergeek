- Today I conducted a literature review. I can't help but feel horrible, if in the future, AI can also do all this so-called research that we do, should the contribution of the research be in the fact that - something can't be done by AI? Human uniqueness is probably what will be at the centre of scientific research, and then EXPERIMENT types of research will be very important - at least they need to be actually performed.
- On the flip side, if I can use an AI agent to design my own SURVEY and publish the study according to the goals of my research question, then the study should be very interesting.
