- Today I used GPT for some small coding tasks - I feel that GPT is becoming more and more like my "external brain" - even if I don't have a systematic knowledge of the minutiae, but only a rough understanding of them. So from a knowledge perspective, there is no doubt that GPT expands one's capabilities.
- I talked to Ben today and he supported me in exploring the potential of prompt learning.
