- Today one of my CS students consulted me on how to use GPT4 for her purpose of generating questions and answers for her final exam.
- I used kimi.ai to help me with the mapping assignment today. During the process I found some bugs which he still hasn't corrected, but I found and fixed them during my reading of the code.
- I also used kimi.ai today to help me write some functions for R analysis. I found that after using it more, I've gradually become more knowledgeable. That is, I didn't know it and I always asked GPT, but after these same code snippets appeared more times, I learnt them (because of GPT, I had more exposure to new knowledge).
