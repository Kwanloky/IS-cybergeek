- I still worked on the code today and finished generating a series of variables. During the process I realized that actually every time I ask a question, there are some mistakes that I often make, so I was thinking - how nice it would be if GPT could monitor my behavior and proactively find out where I can improve (for example, I don't have a deep understanding of the .iloc method, which creates a huge nuisance of back-and-forth).
