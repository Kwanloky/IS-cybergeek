- Today I was discussing with my friend my preliminary conclusions - that individuals can receive AI answers and show ambivalence. He thinks it's a good story, but further testing is needed to see if that's exactly the case. I think my conclusions do reveal some underlying mechanisms that are useful for us to understand clearly the decision-making preferences of individuals in the age of AIGC. I feel proud and happy - this is the kind of research I want to do.
- Recently I've gotten into a new groove - using ChatGPT (GPT4), Gemini (Gemini 1.5), and Kimi.ai at the same time - and I've found that using all three GPTs at the same time gives me a lot more inspiration. One inspiration is that we can actually design experiments using the number of simultaneous use of ChatGPT-like software as the independent variable. That's an interesting point.
