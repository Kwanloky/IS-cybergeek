- Today was a big day for me, I started by purchasing a poe.com membership so I could use a lot of advanced models!
- On top of that I completed a task using Claude 3. It was a task to categorise the keywords of a question. claude 3 did a great job.
- In addition to this, I tried to build my own prompt to help me with translations and touch-ups, and I found it very important to think carefully and deeply about this, as I have been very shallow in the past.
