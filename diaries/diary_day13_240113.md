- Today I am also utilizing GPT for my coding work, GPT store seems to have a variable quality of applications due to the low bar, some even say it is better to just use ChatGPT. i think GPT store also has his unique need for a prompt and this prompt should be more demanding because GPTs are more complex (in the past, people were only dealing with a single ChatGPT)
