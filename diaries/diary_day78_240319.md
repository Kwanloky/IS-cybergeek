- Today I completed a "Quality Assessment" task based on the Kimi.ai API. I found that there are some issues that we should be concerned about in this type of task. Firstly, in terms of their accuracy, they were pretty good, but this time I just designed the prompts randomly - so a possible future study would be how to design the prompts so that they are more accurate in measuring quality.
- On top of that, I've found that there are some limitations to APIs based on large companies. For example, for technical questions about cybersecurity, the API doesn't return any answers for security reasons, even if you don't have malicious intent to use it.
