- Today I mainly did the same data tagging work as the day before, but I didn't rely on GPT too much because I found that GPT's memory was not as good as I thought - which led to me having to interrupt the task to correct his mistakes. So GPT is not yet very good at human-computer collaboration (or maybe my prompt wasn't designed well enough).
