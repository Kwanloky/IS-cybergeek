- Today I updated the README.md and combed through the output I was hoping to have. I feel a little clearer about the purpose of this project
- I used GPT for coding activities today, and in one small task GPT gave a really good idea. I think communicating with GPT is a lot like the so-called Minimum Viable Plan (MVP) in business, which can provide a lot of MVPs to broaden your horizons. So is MVP a good prompt? I think it can be tried. The self-ethnography allows me to keep trying prompt to leave the most useful prompts for everyone, which is one of the important meanings of this project for the community.
- Other than that I don't think a diary should start at the end of the day. Tomorrow I hope that at the very beginning I will open the diary file in the backstage and record what I think at any time. This is what our self-ethnography software should be able to do.
- I don't think diaries should be something you go through often, so I need to organize my diary for the week once a week and store them in categories inside key insights.
