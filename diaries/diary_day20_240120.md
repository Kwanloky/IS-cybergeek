- Today I used GPT to help me with part of my code. The code went wrong during this process, and again I mistakenly thought it was a GPT error, when in fact it should have been the vscode environment. So an important environmental factor cries out - the uncertainty of the work environment. I think algorithmic mistakes have more serious consequences when the work environment is uncertain.
