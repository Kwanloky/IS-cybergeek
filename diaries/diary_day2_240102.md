- Today I've been parsing local crawled files and using GPT4 technology has helped me a lot. During this process, I feel more and more that you can't blindly rely on GPT4 or you will get into a very significant waste of time. The right approach should be, when GPT4 proposes a method you don't understand, don't blindly go to copy and paste and run the code, try to understand the new method and reason whether it can work. From a learning perspective, learning something new is more important than being able to get a code that you don't know the details of to run and output something. Blindness could lead to more significant damage.
- Next, I think I should refine some of the tasks for this geek program, starting with some weekly and monthly goals I should set.
- In addition to that, I hope that I can do some more underlying work besides using LLMs, instead of just using off-the-shelf LLMs-based software!
