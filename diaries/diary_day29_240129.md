- Today I finished labeling 10,000 pieces of data.
- Today GPT helped me with python and R code writing. I think my usage regarding GPT has come to a standstill lately.
- I will be working on text categorization tasks from 0 in the coming week. We will be using traditional statistical machine learning and deep learning (BERT) techniques. I'm looking forward to GPT as my lead.
