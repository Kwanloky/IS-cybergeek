- Tomorrow I'm going to do a summary of the progress of the project so far, which is necessary.
- One thing I noticed today is that there are people who don't understand GPT who pretend to understand it because they have been exposed to it. For example, some people say "theoretically a big model plus a search engine interface to make a smart body is fine, someone should do it." . In fact this is exactly what OPENAI's GPT store has already done. Anyone who has even used ChatGPT should know this fact.
- I also analyzed data today on a project centered around AIGC, and my next step will be to validate how many levels of experts AIGC's effectiveness is equivalent to.
