- Today I used kimi.ai to help me with code debugging. i described the confusion in my head directly to him. It gave me some possible ideas. But in the end I didn't solve the problem according to his ideas. But still I benefited from the process of sorting out my mind thoughts.
- One big news today is the release of Devin from CognitionAI, the AI software that can work like a programmer.
