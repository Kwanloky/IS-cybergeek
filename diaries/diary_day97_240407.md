- Today I worked on data analysis for an AI project.
- A very important thought that came to my mind today while I was in the shower was - I want to create my own LLMs that explore the data on their own. the process is roughly like this, first we have to provide the raw data along with the descriptions of the data fields, the LLMs evaluate whether there should be any causality between each two-by-two combination of the variables or not. If it exceeds a certain threshold, it enters the hypothesis pool. For each hypothesis in the hypothesis pool (involving both independent and dependent variables), the LLMs assess whether all the remaining variables are confounder for the effect we are interested in, and whether they are worth controlling for. We then have a series of regression models. Next we can also automate the regression models. Until we find a better story.
