- I was in a hurry to analyse the AI project today, so I didn't add the progress in time.
- Today I used kimi.ai for code widgets and also debugged using it.I seem to be used to having a commanding tone with the AI. My instructor mentioned that there are times when you can make the AI work better by using a bad tone with it. Will this make myself even more ill-tempered?
