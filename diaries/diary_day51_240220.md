- Today, I was annoyed for a long time because onedrive could not synchronize shared folders in my computer. Finally, after many attempts, we realized that using outlook.com can solve this problem to some extent. But there were still a lot of problems. This made me think that in the past, there were always a lot of strange problems with the operating system, which were super time-consuming to solve. In the future, will there be a real AI operating system, which can avoid strange bugs to a certain extent, and fix the bugs automatically?
- Today my teacher recommended Kimi.ai, a new AI tool, and after trying it out, I think its output is really fast, which seems to be the commonality of all new ChatGPT-like products, and one thing that surpasses ChatGPT.
