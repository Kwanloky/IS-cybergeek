- Today I heard a fresh take on the GPT - aligning the GPT may be a PUA. i think there are very important research questions behind this thought. I'll think about this topic in depth later.
- Today I solved a very important problem in data processing. But this problem is very hard to debug, so it took me super long. One of the reasons for this is that I relied too much on GPT, which resulted in a lot of technical debt that worked in the short term but was harmful in the long term. That's something worth proving.
