- I used GPT to help me fine tune BERT today and it went relatively smoothly giving me some major results. But I found that GPT didn't seem to help me very much in the process of tuning the parameters.
- Tomorrow I will complete the LDA text analysis with the help of him.
- Overall, GPT has helped me achieve tasks I would not have dared to imagine in the past (and fast)
