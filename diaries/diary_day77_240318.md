- Today I called the kimi.ai API and completed the text analysis task. That is, the task of assessing the objective quality of responses as I said before. The results were pretty good.
- Today I revealed an interesting conclusion - AI crowds out experienced people and therefore makes their positive effects unavailable.
- By the way, the API calls mentioned in the first point are very expensive. 6000 calls with an average of 500 tokens will cost nearly 100 RMB in total.
