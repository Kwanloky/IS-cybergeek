This project is dedicated to using self-ethnography methods to document and analyze the personal reflections of Information Systems (IS) scholars during the transformative era of Large Language Models (LLMs). The project aims to explore how these advanced AI technologies are influencing the academic and personal perspectives of IS experts.

Here are some outputs I would like to see with the help of LLMs:
- R package for convenient causal inference when adding control and comparing coeff.
- Self-ethnography software for reminding and structural recording
- PhD stimuator for my future student
- Homepage templates for IS scholar
- Handbook for prompt engineering in IS
- Emoticon package
- ...
